It's been a while since I've put something on here. The website is still up though, as you can tell. Work has been on hold for almost a year now, but the project hasn't been abandoned.

It looks like in the coming months I will finally have some time to put into this. Hence this post. **I'm getting back to work.**

I've been thinking about some of the issues with some of the design decisions I've made during development so far, and there's definitely room for improvement. That said, there are some aspects that I very much like and will attempt to expand upon.

I'm really excited about putting more time into this project. Let's do this!
