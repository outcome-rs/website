# Project Status

Project is currently **active**, though worked on mainly in spare time and on the weekends.

As of late 2020, major rewrite of the engine is nearing completion. Stay tuned.

-----

Much of the core design work has been completed. Some experimental software has already been written and is currently being expanded upon. There is still much work to be done until a large-scale demo can be presented.

Most of the code is written in the [*Rust programming language*](https://www.rust-lang.org) and released as free and open-source software. With the right tools and a little patience you should be able to build and play around with the existing tools.
